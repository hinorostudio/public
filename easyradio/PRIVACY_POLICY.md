# Privacy Policy for EasyRadio

**Last updated:** February 12, 2026  
**Effective date:** February 12, 2026

---

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how **EasyRadio** ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information when you use our Android application available on Google Play. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information you provide
The app does not require an account. You may optionally add radio stations to your favorites; this information is stored only on your device (see section 4).

### 2.2 Information collected automatically
- **Usage of the app:** Favorites and app preferences (e.g. last played station) are stored locally on your device. We do not collect or transmit this data to our servers.
- **Advertising:** When you use the free version of the app, Google AdMob may collect device and usage data (such as device ID, IP address, and ad interaction data) to deliver and measure ads. This is governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Google's Ads policies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).

### 2.3 Third-party catalogue data
To provide the radio station catalogue (search, countries, tags, languages), the app connects to the **Radio Browser API** (e.g. api.radio-browser.info). When you search or play a station, requests are sent to that service (e.g. station UUID, search parameters). We do not control the data practices of Radio Browser; you may refer to their documentation or terms for more information.

---

## 3. How We Use Information

- To provide radio streaming, search, and browsing.
- To store your favorites and preferences on your device.
- To show ads in the free version (via AdMob).
- To process in-app purchases (e.g. premium / no ads) through Google Play Billing; payment and purchase data are handled by Google according to [Google Play's terms and privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

We do not sell your personal data.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

- **On your device:** Favorites and app settings (including premium status and last played station) are stored locally using the device's storage. Uninstalling the app removes this data.
- **Advertising:** Data processed by AdMob is retained according to Google's policies.
- **Radio Browser:** Requests to their API are subject to their retention and logging practices.

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We may share or your data may be processed by:

| Third party        | Purpose                    | Privacy / terms |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| **Google AdMob**   | Ads in the free version    | [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| **Google Play**    | App distribution, in-app purchases | [Google Play terms](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/) |
| **Radio Browser**  | Station catalogue and stream URLs  | Their API/documentation |

We do not sell or rent your personal information to other parties. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and safety.

---

## 6. Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

- **Internet** – to stream radio and load the station catalogue and ads.
- **Foreground service / Media playback** – to play audio in the background and support Android Auto.
- **Notifications** – to show playback controls (optional; you can deny).
- **Wake lock** – to keep playback from stopping when the screen is off.

We do not access your contacts, location, or other sensitive data beyond what is needed for these features.

---

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

- **Favorites and preferences:** Stored only on your device; you can clear them by clearing app data or uninstalling.
- **Ads:** In the free version, ads are shown via AdMob; you can limit ad personalisation in your [Google account ad settings](https://adssettings.google.com/).
- **No ads:** You can purchase the premium version to remove ads (Google Play Billing).
- **Access, deletion, portability:** We do not maintain user accounts or central user databases. For AdMob and Google Play data, you can use Google's tools and policies (e.g. [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/)).

If you are in the European Economic Area or the UK, you may have additional rights (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection). You can contact us (see section 10) to exercise them to the extent we process your data.

---

## 8. Children's Privacy

The app is not directed at children under 13 (or higher age in certain jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

---

## 9. Security

We use standard technical measures (e.g. HTTPS where applicable) for data in transit. Data stored on your device is protected by your device's security. We do not operate our own servers that store your personal data.

---

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new "Last updated" date and, where required by law, we will notify you (e.g. in the app or on the Play Store listing). Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
